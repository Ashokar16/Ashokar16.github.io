<center><h2><u>Work, Power and Energy</u></h2></center>
<p class="ye">Work: Work is done when a force that is applied to an object moves that object, and is calculated using the formula W=F*d, where force is multiplied by distance. Runners have to to maximize the amount of force and distance they can run to maximize the work output, which increases the efficiency of their running, which is calculated by dividing their work output by work input, and multiplying it by 100 to find a percentage that represents their work, the more work they put in, the more efficient runners they are, and the better they are than their peers.</p> 
<center><h2><u>
Potential and Kinetic Energy
</u></h2></center>
<p class="ye">When somebody is running, they have to convert potential energy into kinetic energy, where potential energy is used to move the system it is stored in, into kinetic energy that moves the system in a horizontal direction.</p>
<p class="ye">In our bodies, potential energy is stored as chemical energy, which comes from the food that we eat during the day, in fact, we need a certain amount of energy to transform into kinetic energy. This explains we sweat after any activity overall, we're literally burning calories, to move horizontally, and it releases thermal energy, and our bodies cool us down with sweat.</p>

<center><h2><u>
Momentum
</u></h2></center>
<p class="ye">Momentum is the product of an object's mass and velocity. Without using momentum, runners require extra force on the ground to maintain a certain speed, or require even more to increase speed, which requires more calories to be burned and can overheat the runner by converting potential energy that isn't there, into potential energy. If you think about it, the Theory of Conservation of Momentum is what keeps the runner moving, if you take one step, you will quickly take the next step and the force of the second step is added to the momentum of the first step, which creates a greater running speed.</p>
