     <p> The Razer Blade Stealth is one of the best laptops on the market next to it's rivals like the Dell XPS 13 or the Macbook Pro. It offers probably the best performance of any laptop on the market, despite being so thin. However, it lacks the 4K option that gamers would love to have, and a relatively short battery life. This product is built for the casual gamer who still wants a top performance from their system. Despite the thin build, it comes with a quad-core Intel i7 processor, with integrated Intel UHD graphics, making it more powerful than most custom built PCs.</p>

      <p> In my personal opinion, I do think this is a very powerful device despite it's small build, but I would rather custom build my PC rather than the laptop. The short battery span and lack of 4K makes it unenjoyable because the point of the laptop is that you can play on the go, but the short battery cancels that out. I feel like I would also break this thing because it's so much more thinner than the original razer blade which was already thin enough. Don't get me wrong, I think this is an amazing piece of hardware, but I would rather get a PC that would be more capable of handling games, not run out of battery. Overall, I do believe this laptop is at the top of the industry due to such a thin and small build, and have such powerful hardware within it.
