      <h2 id="poile">Nashville Predators General Manager David Poile Sets New NHL Record for Wins by a GM</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="nhlarticle">
      <p class="paragraph">Nashville Predators GM David Poile becomes the winningest General Manager in NHL history, after his team beat the Edmonton Oilers 4-2, passing Glen Sather who held the top spot. Poile has been an NHL GM for quite the long time. He first began his
        career with the Washington Capitals in 1982, before becoming the GM of the new expansion Nashville Predators. His knack for making good hockey trades, use of analytics,<img src="https://assets4.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/david-poile.jpg"
          width="450" length="500" align="right"> and mastery of negotiating, makes it simple to figure out why his teams barely miss the playoffs. Recent examples of his fine work include; working a 3 way trade for Kyle Turris to bolster their already
        deep center pool, and trading away defensive superstar and captain Shea Weber, for fellow superstar blueliner and 2012-13 James Norris Trophy Winner, P.K. Subban. Poile hopes to complete his now Hall of Fame worthy career by winning the Stanley
        Cup with the already formidable Nashville Predators.</p>

        <h2 id="mamba">Kobe Bryant Wins Oscar, Adds to his Trophy Case</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Despite being retired,<img src="https://pmcfootwearnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/kobe-bryant-oscars-2018.jpg?w=1024" width="250" length="500" align="right"> the Black Mamba is still collecting hardware, this time, from the 90th Academy Awards.
          Bryant, who won "Best Short Film (Animated)," based his now Oscar-winning film "Dear Basketball," off a poem before he announced his retirement in 2015. Bryant worked alongside Star Wars composer John Williams and animated/directed by arist
          Glen Keane. Bryant, a 5-time NBA Champion, 2-time NBA Finals MVP, 2008 NBA MVP, becomes the first ever NBA player to win an Academy Award. The 39-year old legend is still making a case for being the GOAT (Greatest of all time), and is gaining
          acknowledgement from fellow NBA legends such as Lebron James, and former superstar teammate Shaquille O'Neal.</p>

          <h1><strong>NFL Story</strong></h1>
          <h2 id="shaquem">Shaquem Griffin Continues to Defy the Odds</h2>
          <img src="https://images.wsj.net/im-3136?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5" width="500" length="650">
          <p class="paragraph">Despite amniotic band syndrome, a rare condtion which occurs during fetal development, Shaquem Griffin never gave up on his dreams of becoming an NFL player. The condition causes severe pain to the limb, since Griffin's left hand could not function
            properly. His had was amputated after the pain reached a point that Griffin took it upon himself to cut off his own hand, and his mother took him to the hospital after a night of agony, which led to his left hand being amputated. Griffin continued
            on to be one of the best linebackers in college for the University of Central Florida, and posted a breathtaking statline at the NFL's annual combine for future draftees. These numbers include having the best 40-yard dash for a linebacker
            since 2003, and going for 20 reps on a weight that he only posted 11 for, on top of that, he used a prosthetic hand to grip the bar, and required more strength in his left arm. This story shows that dedication, hard work, and a burning passion
            for the thing you love, is all you need to succeed, a truly inspiring story for the kids in our world that give up on their futures because they have similar problems as him, and he proved that you can still chase your dreams no matter what
            stands in your way. </p>
