        Reptiles have a 3 chambered heart with pulmonary and systemic circuits. Some reptiles, such as some alligators and crocodiles, have primitive 4 chambered hearts. There are two main arteries that leave the heart and while one takes blood to the lungs the
        other goes to the stomach and other parts.

        To increase respiratory gas exchange, they have small saclike structures called alveoli in the lungs. Snakes have alveoli in their walls while crocodiles and many lizards and turtles are more proficient, having partitions that have alveoli. Many reptiles,
        not including turtles, breathe by contracting the muscles that move the ribs (this empty cavity is known as the chest cavity) and create a lower pressure which has air just rush in. The rate of respiration is actually dependent on the temperature
        of the environment and the state of the animal. While most reptiles have 2 lungs, snakes have a single lung.

        Most reptiles reproduce sexually. This includes many male snakes that rely on scent to find females and that complete fertilization internally. Most reptiles are egg-laying(oviparous) while many squamates are capable of giving live birth. Many reptiles
        even provide initial care for their hatchlings. Sperm are placed inside the female by internal fertilization. Some reptiles even have sex dependent on incubation temperature. There are 6 families of lizards and a 1 family of snakes that have shown
        asexual reproduction called parthenogenesis (when off springs develop from unfertilized eggs).

        Amphibians have to lay their eggs in water because they have jelly-like structures covered with water, and will dry up if put onto land. Reptiles adapted to this challenge, and were able to create the Amniotic egg, an egg that can be layed and safely
        stored on land. The egg of reptiles and birds is surrounded by a tough outer shell that protects the egg from predators, pathogens , damage, and drying. Oxygen passes through pores in the shell, so the embryo is able to obtain oxygen. Inside the
        shell are four sacs. The first sac inside the shell is the chorion, which carries oxygen from the shell to the embryo and waste carbon dioxide from the embryo to the shell. Within the chorion is the amnion, the membrane for which the amniotic
        egg is named. The amnion keeps the embryo from drying out, which is why it doesn't need a water environment. The allantois, stores wastes from the embryo and also fuses with the chorion to form the chorioallantoic membrane, which carries oxygen
        and carbon dioxide to and from the embryo, just like a lung. A fourth membrane, the yolk sac, holds and digests yolk with nutrients for it.

        - Reptiles have a brain, spinal cord, nerves and sense organs. They have proportionately smaller brains than mammals especially when considering the size of the cerebral hemispheres. Snakes contain special sensitive smell structures on their tongue and
        crocodiles have excellent daytime eyesight.

        Reptiles use two small kidneys for excreting nitrogen from the animal's blood. The nitrogen exits the body as solid uric acid crystals along with the feces. Reptiles lose very little water in waste product. Reptiles lack the Loop of Henle which is present
        in nephrons of birds and mammals. Because they lack this, they use their colons to reabsorb water and some species are able to take up water stored in the bladder. Some reptiles have salt glands present which get rid of excess salts. Reptiles
        have an organ called the cloaca which is where the anus empties into.
