        Amphibians have a double-loop circulatory system. They have a 3-chambered
heart with 2 atria and a ventricle. They have capillaries where materials such as gases and
nutrients are exchanged. Amphibians have pulmonary circulation (through the lungs and back to
the heart) and systemic circulation (throughout the body). The 2 atria receive blood from the
different circuits.

        Amphibians can have lungs or gills. Some animals such as most frogs have a
tadpole stage where they have hills that disappear and lungs develop. Amphibians are able to
breathe through their skin. Amphibians require moist skin for gas exchange and if it were to dry
out, they would not be able to get oxygen. Salamanders are mostly lungless and respiration
occurs through the skin or external gills. Some species will have primitive lungs while others will
have lungs and gills. Amphibian lungs are not as evolved as mammalian lungs. Some adult
amphibians have a reduced or lack diaphragms. The skin is more important than lungs for
breathing for amphibians as most of their breathing is done through their skin. Amphibians use
positive pressure breathing which is inflating the lungs with forced air-flow.

        Amphibians reproduce sexually. Salamanders rely on internal fertilization and
male salamanders, much like frogs, lack copulatory structures. Fertilization among salamanders
involves long and elaborate courtship. Frogs fertilize externally and they lay their eggs in moist
environments to prevent desiccation. Some frogs will look after their eggs until they hatch while
others will ignore them. Some species of caecilians, frogs and salamanders give birth to live
young

        Amphibians, like other vertebrates, possess a central brain, spinal cords and
nerves. The brain is less developed than that of reptiles, birds and mammals. It is similar to a
fish's brain. Tadpoles have the lateral line system and some caecilians have electroreceptors.
Amphibians have a large circular eardrum behind the eye and this vibrates and transmits sound
through a single bone(stapes) to the internal ear. As anurans mature, their eyes become more
complex and they are able to see color and are allow depth of focus

        Amphibians use their pancreas, liver and gall bladder to excrete waste. Sweat
glands also help by excreting many wastes. They excrete waste through feces and urine. Gases
are released by breathing. Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete Nitrogen as
Ammonia through dilute urine, whereas terrestrial species (who need to conserve water) excrete
less toxic urea. Amphibian kidneys function a lot like freshwater fishes. Their kidneys excrete
dilute urine while their skin accumulates certain salts from the water. That is, if they are in fresh
water. On land, they conserve water by reabsorbing water across the urinary bladder.

          Many amphibians catch prey by sticking out their long tongue. The tongue has a
sticky tip that is able to catch prey easily. They draw the prey into their mouth then hold it with
their jaws. Most amphibians eat their prey whole. They have a short esophagus that is lined with
cilia to move the food to the stomach. There is mucus that is made by glands in the mouth and
pharynx that helps its passage. Amphibians possess a complete digestive system. All adult
amphibians are carnivorous.
